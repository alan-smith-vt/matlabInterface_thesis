# matlabInterface_thesis
This repository is provided as supplimentary material to the thesis titled "Extraction of Structural Component Geometries in Point Clouds ofMetal Buildings" by Alan Smith at Virginia Tech.

The file "main_caller.m" located in the "frontEnd" folder is used to launch the program. 

Supplimentary data can be found at the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HyIhwuSyKm5POTmcneWfKGTAE2Jtd99N?usp=sharing

The data downloaded via google drive should be placed in the "previousResults" folder. Based on which data-set is download, uncomment the corresponding line within the matlab "main_caller.m" file to tell the program which data to use. For example, if the VTH (virginia tech hangar) data is downloaded, then the user should uncomment line 17 in the "main_caller.m" file and ensure lines 18-21 are commented out. The user then can launch the program and interact with the selected data.
